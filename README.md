# Tesseris - 3D Rendering Engine built on top of Vulcan + SDL entirely in C.

Tesseris is a simple 3D rendering engine I've been working while learning Projective Geometry from [@this-vijay](https://github.com/this-vijay)'s [course on projective geometry](https://this-vijay.github.io/vision-math/) along with this book [Foundations for projective geometry - Hartshorne](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/reu/lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fmedia=hartshorne_foundations_of_projective_geometry.pdf). I'd also recommend checking out [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) for more info on vulcan.

I'll add in more features as I go along with the course. My hope is that I can create a functioning 3D rendering engine to showcase the many fun quirks of projective geometry; and eventually somehow visualize a 4D scene projected onto a 2D plane. Sort of like a 4D rendering engine, you can call it. 

Here is an image of where it was at a few weeks ago. Will keep updates on this ReadMe; I am currently rewriting the entire thing, because I didn't include proper GPU support.
