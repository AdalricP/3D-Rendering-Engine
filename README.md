# Tesseris - 3D Rendering Engine

Tesseris is a simple 3D rendering engine I've been working while learning Projective Geometry, build then run the first example using ./cube.

I'll add in more features and examples as I go along with the book. For mathematical reference you check out the book [Foundations of Projective Geometry by Robin Hartshorne.](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~dejong/reu/lib/exe/fetch.php%3Fmedia=hartshorne_foundations_of_projective_geometry.pdf)
